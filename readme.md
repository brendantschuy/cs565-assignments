<h1>CS 565 In-class assignments</h1>

<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>I created a Git repository for all my assignments, started out with some basic HTML concepts, and reproduced the HTML tags for everyone's favorite image API service, <a href="https://placekitten.com">placekitten.com</a>. Lastly, I got to work starting on my midterm portfolio with a site with some basic info about me.</p>

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<p>This week was all about CSS. I updated each of the web pages from the first assignment to look a little bit snazzier. CSS-Grid was extremely helpful with the design of the placekitten copy website. I initially tried to implement this using Flexbox -- don't do it. Grids, surprisingly, are best implemented with CSS Grid.</p>

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>This week expanded on Week 2 and did a bit more work with CSS frameworks. Bootstrap has so many options and abilities, I learn something new every time I use it. I implemented Layouts #1, 2, and 5 using Bootstrap, CSS-Grid, and Flexbox. I think Bootstrap is easily capable of any of these layouts, but I wanted to do something a little more than trivial with CSS-Grid. In Layout 2, the last row takes up the entire width of the page, so I had to do a bit of digging to figure out how to do that. Meanwhile, Layout 5 seemed easy to do with the one-dimensional approach of Flexbox.</p>

<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
<p>This assignment covered basic JavaScript. FizzBuzz was pretty simple to implement. For reversing the digits in a number, I implemented this two ways: one, by casting the number as a string and reversing the array; and two, by doing a bit of math with moduli and exponents of 10. Exercises 4 and 5 both had me learn some new things. Although I do JS for my work, I had never tried to randomly generate hex codes or output the size of the window.</p>

<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
<p>Here, we used Express to create a simple website. I'm fairly experienced with Node by using React at work, but I'd never used Express before. Setting up the middleware is always the biggest challenge for me: communication is hard sometimes, especially between webpages. Fortunately, Express made this a lot easier than it usually is.</p>

<h2>Assignment 6</h2>
<p>Lastly, I did three tutorials for assignment 6. I chose React to make sure I hadn't missed anything when learning this at work over the last few months. It's interesting to see what kind of depth various tutorials go into that you may miss by learning a topic with a different method. In this instance, the concept of "lifting state up" was something new to me. The other tutorials I did were TypeScript and Express. I've never used TypeScript before, but I've seen how popular it's become and I would love to learn more on that topic. The same goes for Express -- my first exposure to web development was .NET and Spring Framework (Java), so I always love to see ways of setting up websites that aren't a headache and a half. Things like Flask in Python and Express with Node definitely fill that niche.</p>
